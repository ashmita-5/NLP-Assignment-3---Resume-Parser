The Resume Parser is updated by adding the functionality to extract skills, education and contact information.The SpaCy's entity recognition capabilities to identify and extract these additional details from the resume text.

Users can view the extracted information presented in a table format on the web page. Additionally, they have the option to download this information as a CSV file. This functionality is achieved by converting the extracted information from a dictionary format into a CSV file, allowing users to select and download the file for their use.

The Flask application is set up to handle file uploads, allowing users to upload their resumes in PDF format. Upon upload, an enhanced resume parser extracts various details like skills, work experience, education, and contact information, organizing them into a structured format. The extracted information is then presented on the web page in a clear and structured manner using HTML and CSS for an intuitive user experience. Additionally, the application offers download options for users to obtain the extracted information in CSV format, achieved through dynamic file generation based on the extracted data.
